# Exploratory Data Analysis on RA Grades

## Important: Privacy and Fair Use 
To maintain privacy, identifiers (First name, surname, email, roll number) have been removed from the original xlsx. Before removing roll number, it was used to find branch and whether a student is dual degree or not. For code related to cleaning and privacy, please see `privacy.py`. The original xlsx file is not included in this repo for privacy. Since the original xlsx was public to anyone who took the course and I have removed personal identifiers, I believe I can use the data for analysis.

## Running Locally
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install or upgrade necessary libraries
3. There is no need to run `privacy.py` since it is for one time use and has already been run. The generated csv files are in the `data` folder.
4. Run `jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb` or open `analysis.ipynb` with VSCode or another code editor.
